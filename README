Benthos is an open-source dive logging application modeled on MacDive but
built to run on Linux and Windows.  Benthos leverages two shared libraries to
provide logbook access (benthos-logbook) as well as dive computer interface 
(benthos-dc).  Both libraries are released independently under a BSD license
for third party integration.

This code is released under the GPL Version 2
